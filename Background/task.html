            A self-occupied property is a property occupied by the taxpayer for residential purposes.  The owner of such a property does not earn any rental income from this type of property. This excludes a property being used for commercial purposes.
            As per the income tax laws, a person can claim a maximum of two houses as self-occupied. Hence, these properties will not be subject to tax on notional rental income. However, this rule applies to each taxpayer separately and not to a family as a unit.

            Before moving to roadmap how to Software developers it is very important to know the who are software developers and what are their work.
            So, software developers are the architects of the digital world, breathing life into ideas by designing, building, testing, and maintaining the software that powers everything from your smartphone apps to self-driving cars. They analyze needs, translate them into code, solve problems along the way, and constantly adapt to keep software running smoothly and evolving with user needs. They are the builders and maintainers of the digital landscape, shaping our daily lives through invisible lines of code.
            Software developers are the architects of the digital world we inhabit, building the applications, systems, and websites that power everything from your smartphone to self-driving cars. Their job is to take abstract ideas and transform them into functional, user-friendly software, using their coding skills and creativity to solve real-world problems.
