                  India has become one of the worlds promising tourist destination with large number of visitors each year for its diverse climatic features and heritage cultures. It has a dramatic growth of tourism over the last 25  years  and it is one of the  most  remarkable  economic  changes.  India is  the  only  country that  offers different categories of tourism year by year to the visitors. The Indian government took efforts to encourage different kinds of tourism in  India.  Indian government adopted different approaches for the  promotion of tourism in India. India plans to modify the visa policy during 2014 by allowing visitors from most countries to obtain an electronic visa online. The Indian government decided to increase revenues from the tourism sector  by  projecting  India  as  the  "ultimate tourist  spot". So  there is  no doubt  that the  development  of tourism industry in India is very strong in the next ten years. Key words: Economic Impact, Employment practices, Foreign exchange, LGBT citizen, Incredible India, Tourism Introduction There are several  sectors in  India where  the worth  and potential  of their assets  have not really been fully utilised or harnessed. The tourism  sector is one  of them. Tourism  accounts for 6.8% of India‟s GDP and is  the  third  largest earner of foreign exchange with earnings of  $18.13 billion in 2013. India ranks 42 in foreign tourists arrivals as per the United Nations World Tourist Organisation. If many in the world still have a picture of India being a dirty and often unsafe place, they have only half the story.  There has been considerable progress since the days when India was seen as a land of beggars, snake charmers and elephants. Admittedly there‟s much we need to do to get rid of this image by enhancing levels of hygiene and security especially for women visitors, but we  have  been  blessed  with  many  positives.  For  the  first  time  in  our  history,  a  nationwide Government backed  initiative close  to the heart  of our Prime  Minister has been  launched for  a Clean India. The  Swachh Bharat  campaign  is  still  in a nascent stage but  should show  positive results over the next few years. The tourists can enjoy different kind of tourism i.e; Eco Tourism, Health  Tourism,  Adventure  Tourism,  Cultural  Tourism,  Heritage  Tourism,  Wildlife  Tourism, Religious tourism, etc. Only in India the tourists can enjoy all these kinds of tourism together. The survey according to FICCI (Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) states that there is a very bright future for the tourism industry in India. India has always been known for its diverse climate, hospitality, uniqueness etc this is the reason why India has been doing well in all types of tourism in India.

                 <h1>Tourism and Job of People </h1>
                 In many countries,  tourism  acts as  an engine  for development  through foreign exchange earnings  and  the  creation  of  direct  and  indirect  employment.  Tourism  contributes  5%  of  the world‟s GDP. It accounts for 6% of the world‟s exports in services being the fourth largest export sector after fuels, chemicals and automotive products. Tourism is responsible for 235 million jobs or one in every 12 jobs worldwide. Tourism in many developing and least developed countries is the most viable and sustainable economic development option, and in some countries, the main source of foreign exchange earnings [3]. Part of this income trickles down to different groups of the society and, if tourism is managed with a strong focus on poverty alleviation, it can directly benefit the poorer groups through employment of local people in tourism enterprises, goods and services provided to tourists, or the running of small and community-based enterprises, etc, having positive impacts on reducing poverty levels [4,7,14]. Tourism is a relatively labour intensive sector and  is  traditionally  made  up  of  small  and  micro  enterprises.  Many  activities  in  tourism  are particularly  suited  to women,  young people  and disadvantaged  groups  such  as  ethnic  minority populations.  Many  tourism  jobs  are  potentially  quite  accessible  to  the  poor  as  they  require relatively few  skills and little  investment. Some may  also be  part time and  used to  supplement income from other activities [4,8]. As so many different activities and inputs make up the tourism product, which has a large and diversified supply chain, spending by tourists can benefit a wide range  of sectors  such  as  agriculture,  handicrafts,  transport  and  other  services  [15].  Additional rounds of spending by those people whose income is supported by tourism spread the economic benefit  further  (the  multiplier  effect).  Tourism,  unusually,  is  an  activity  which  brings  the consumers  to  the  producers  [16].  The interaction  between  tourists  and  poor  communities  can provide  a  number  of  intangible  and  practical  benefits  [17].  These  can  range  from  increased awareness of cultural,  environmental, and  economic issues and values, on  both sides,  to mutual benefits from improved local investment in infrastructure [18].  Conclusion  India‟s travel and tourism sector ranks 7th in the world in terms of its total contribution to the country‟s GDP, according to a new report of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). According to data, the travel and tourism sector generated Rs 14.1 trillion (USD208.9 billion) in 2016,  which  is  world‟s  7th  largest in  terms  of  absolute  size;  the  sum  is  equivalent  to  9.6%  of India‟s  GDP. Additionally,  the  sector created 40.3  million jobs in 2016,  which ranks  India 2nd in the world in terms of total employment generated. The sector accounts for 9.3% of the country‟s total  jobs. India‟s  Travel  and  Tourism  sector  was  also  the  fastest  growing  amongst  the  G20 countries, growing by 8.5% in 2016. A further 6.7%  growth is  forecast for  2017. As  travel and tourism marketing has shifted online, destinations have increasingly found themselves competing in a global  marketplace. Over  the  past  six  decades, almost  without interruption,  the  volume  of cross-border travel has increased year-on-year, and today travellers are able to access their chosen destinations more easily.  In order to stand out, those  responsible for destination marketing have sought  to  make their  destinations attractive  to emerging  consumer  segments, particularly  those segments of the market that are perceived to travel more frequently and exhibit higher levels of spending than  others. Tourism is very sensitive to  economic, environmental, and socio-political
